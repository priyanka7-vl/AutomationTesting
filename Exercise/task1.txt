Software Testing Exercise-1::
1.What is software testing?
   - Software testing is a process of evaluating the functionality of a software application and to check whether the developed application is working correctly or not and to identify defects and make it defect free to produce with best quality.

2.Types of testing methods?
   1.Static testing:
    - Static testing is a method of verification in software project.
   2.Dynamic testing:
    - Dynamic testing is a method of validation in a software project.

3.Difference between verification and validation?
   1.verification:
    - Verification is the process of checking the developing project.
    - Verification is to verify whether we are developing the project rightly or not.
    - Verification is the process of verifying the documents,design,code and program
    - It involves before executing the code.
    - It checks whether the software confirms to specifications or not.
    - It uses methods like reviews,desk-checking.
    - It finds the bugs early in the development cycle.
    - Target is application,complete design and database design.
    - It is done before the validation process.
2.validation:
    - Validation is the process of checking the developed project.
    - Validation is to validate which we have developed the project rightly or not.
    - It is the dynamic testing of application.
    - It involves after the code execution.
    - It can find bugs in the verification process.
    - It checks the software met specified requirements or not.
    - It uses methods like black box testing,white box testing and non-functional testing.
    - Target is an actual product.
    - It is done after the verification process.

4.What is the functional testing and give me the types of functional testing?
Functional testing:
  - Functional testing is the process of checking the functionality of the system met with specified requirements.
  - To check each functionality with appropriate input to verify whether actual output match with expected one.
Types of functional testing:
1.Unit testing:
  - It is to check each module of source code and every unit of the system.
  - Testing is done at unit level i.e individually done for each component separately.
2.Integration Testing:
  - It is the process of testing data connectivity and data transfer between each unit tested modules.
  - It has divided into two categories:
          a.top-down approach:
	- It is the process of testing from main module to sub module.
	- If the sub module is not developed then a temporary program STUB is used to simulate the sub module.
           b.bottom-up approach
	- It is the process of testing from sub module to main module.
	- If the main module is not developed then a temporary program Drivers is used to simulate the main module.
3.System testing:
  - It is also called as end to end testing.
  - Testing integrated system is working properly or not on all target systems.
4.Acceptance testing:
  - It is for delivering to end user i.e acceptable by customer and receiving payments.

5.What is the non-functional testing and give me the types of non-functional testing?
Non-Functional testing:
  - Non-functional testing is the process of checking how fastly the system is responding to the request.
Types of non-functional testing:
1.Performance testing:
  - It is to verify whether the developed software is working correctly under workload also.
2.Load testing:
  - It is to know that how system works on normal and peak load conditions.
3.Scalability testing
  - How much the application can be scalable in other systems
4.Security testing
  - It is to know how much the system's data can be protected and maintained.
5.Compatibility testing
  - Whether the application is working as expected in different environments.
6.Usability testing:
  - Whether the builded software is user friendly or not.
